""" Extension of matplotlib collections.

Classes for the efficient drawing of large collections of objects that
share most properties, e.g., a large number of line segments or
polygons.

The classes are not meant to be as flexible as their single element
counterparts (e.g., you may not be able to select all line styles) but
they are meant to be fast for common use cases (e.g., a large set of solid
line segemnts)
