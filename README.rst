Plotting biological data in `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_.

Bioplotlib is a library extending the capabilities of the python plotting library `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ to support plotting of biological data.
It is a project started out of frustration with the current tools to visualise biological data.
Many plotting libraries do some things well, but often over-simplify the process making it difficult to extend its capabilities.

Bioplotlib provides shapes and convenient methods to plot: genomic features, alignments, cladograms and phylogenies, ideograms, and linkage maps.
It is designed to drop in seamlessly with `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ so that you still have access to native plotting geometries (eg. histograms and scatterplots).
Furthermore, being written in python means that you get access to all of the computational goodies that `jupyter http://jupyter.org/`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, and `biopython <http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ packages have to offer.
